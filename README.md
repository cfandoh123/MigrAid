# MigrAid

MigrAid is an AI-powered, privacy-first resource navigator designed to help immigrants, refugees, and undocumented individuals access critical legal, healthcare, food, and shelter resources. The app is built with a deep equity focus, prioritizing multilingual support, anonymity, and community-driven reporting.

## Project Overview

**MigrAid** addresses systemic barriers faced by immigrants, including language gaps, fear of authorities, lack of centralized information, and digital exclusion. The app empowers users to find and report resources safely, with a simple, icon-driven interface and robust privacy features.

- **Anonymous Mode**: Users can browse and report without providing personal information.
- **Resource Navigation**: Find clinics, legal aid, food support, and shelters by category or proximity.
- **Interactive Map**: Location-based resource discovery with React Native Maps.
- **ICE Activity Reporting**: Community-sourced, anonymous reporting of ICE activity.
- **Advocate Dashboard**: For community advocates to manage resources and review reports.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, accessible interface with gradient backgrounds and intuitive navigation.

### Planned Features

- **Voice Interface**: Navigation and reporting via voice commands for low-literacy users.
- **Offline Resource Download**: Access resources without internet connectivity.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Protect user data and reports.
- **Blockchain Proof-of-Help**: Reward system for community contributions.
